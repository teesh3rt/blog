when i say that this blog is "a blog about everything", i **dont mean that i know everything**, im just giving myself the ability to **be wrong, and discuss my opinions and thoughts here on the internet**.

when i say that this blog is "a blog about everything", i **dont mean that i will talk about everything**, im just giving myself the ability to **discuss whatever i want, whenever i want**.

when i say that this blog is "a blog about everything", i **dont mean that i am interested in everything**, im just giving myself the ability to **ignore or otherwise not blog about topics or events that i do not care about**.

i hope this clears it up for some of you, and i hope you have a good day! - teesh
