hello, kind strangers of the internet! welcome to my little corner of this vast place.

you will most probably not find much here, as this is a little personal place for me to just blog about stuff and have some fun, but i hope that whatever little you may find will be good. :)

my name is teesh (or teesh3rt on some other places). im a developer, and i like just making stuff for fun! i like to make games, websites, and anything where i can express my "creativity" (or lack thereof) on a digital canvas.

i call this blog a "blog about everything": i just write about whatever i want to write about. this blog will probably not have one central topic, and will even probably expand in the future.

to whoever is reading this, i hope you have a pleasant day! - teesh
