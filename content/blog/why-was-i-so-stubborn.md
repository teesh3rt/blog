## prelude

a couple months ago (half a year if i remember correctly), i decided to take some advice from some family members of mine, and installed cursor.
i tried using it to develop a simple video editing script for a video i needed to make, i told it to use moviepy, and it worked like a charm.
little did i know, this would become an addiction, and would destroy everything i know about the nature of the creation of software.

## the joy of mindless creation

so i'd picked up cursor, and so i continued messing around until i could no longer mess around with the error message of too much, and so i hopped on to the next agent: github copilot. then i continued messing around, ran into limits, and hopped onto windsurf. then i continued messing around, ran into limits, and hopped on and on and on... and you know what?

i started to enjoy it, that joy of mindless creation: simply having an idea, and popping it into existence. i was no longer really thinking of code, but moreso of solutions. i had sort of become a product manager less a programmer. of course, i still coded, but it mostly was just tweaks.

i had not yet realized this has completely overtaken me: i used to **hate** vibe coding with a **passion**! and yet... here i was, prompting agents everywhere and anywhere! i even looked past the barrier of code and onto mcp servers! it managed my notion, for god's sake!

eventually, i stopped the hopping, and arrived at opencode.

now, at opencode, i stopped for a little bit: this worked, in fact this worked great, for a while. while it had no limits, i personally found opencode to be quite limiting in other factors, namely how dumb their models were. they would usually take a whole lot of prompts to solve a simple task. and so, i looked past the 20$ barrier...

onto **claude code.**

## we shape our tools and our tools shape us

(i should preface this with the fact that i have only been using claude code for a week or so, so take this with a salt shaker.)

and so, i bit the 20$/mo bullet, and bought myself a subscription to claude pro. i launched claude code for the first time on a project in which i have not vibe coded at all, and decided to test it out. i first commited my changes to git so i can easily revert back to the stone age if neccesary, and asked it something like the following:

"given the following project, inspect the codebase, and write a plan on how to add blah blah blah. then, when i give you the get-go, begin implementing said blah blah blah."

instantly, it came to life: three explore agents popped up, all doing different things: one exploring the codebase, one thinking of how to properly add the feature, and one planning based on results from the other two. it was incredible, if i do say so myself. then, just watching it run commands, and do exactly what i thought it would do, was amazing!

in the middle of its doing, i stopped it, and asked it to do something a certain different way. instantly, it continued, exactly where it left off. all the while i was saying to myself, in my language (which sounds like im insane with how i say it), in a sort of manic manner, "it works for meeeeeee! for me, it works!!!!!"

i had officially gone insane. i might not have been truly vibe coding since i was checking the results and using the model more as a tool for quick development, but even this was insane to my reluctant brain. to other people, normalcy in this day and age, but for me, insanity. pure, unadulterated insanity.

## the million dollar question

why have i been so stubborn? why have i refused to try even a tiny lick of the lollipop all this time? i am going to be honest here, this might sound like a crypto bro opinion...

i thought it would replace me, and i would no longer need to work. i thought it would replace me, and i would no longer be useful. i thought it would replace me, and my work could no longer be credible.

perhaps i have been viewing it a wrong and different way this time, perhaps it had simply clicked for me while working on said fateful video editing project, who knows!

## ending

how i got to this point, i do not know. how i will get out of it, i do not know either.

do i even want to get out? is it something ill want to do in the future?

who knows, the tools shaped me, i may be too far gone now.
